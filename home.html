            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The aim of this visualization assignment is to produce a visualization to display<br>
                information regarding the migration patterns of healthcare workers, to identify<br>
                whether there are patterns or preferred locations. Additionally, to identify whether<br>
                there were any changes to the preference before and after covid-19.</p>

        <section id="TargetAudience">
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>This visualization is targeted towards students in the healthcare sector so that they <br>
                can use this information to find out which are the preferred locations to pursue their<br>
                career and as a starting point for that research. Another target user which could<br> 
                use this information is policy makers as this can assist them in seeing which countries<br> 
                are attracting most of their healthcare workforce and try to identify the reasons.</p>
